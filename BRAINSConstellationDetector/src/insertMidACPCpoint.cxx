// This program adds a new landmark as the midpoint between AC and PC points to the output landmark fcsv file

// This program gets a landmark1.fcsv file as its input and returns landmark2.fcsv file which contains
// the new added landmark "midACPC" which is the midpoint between AC and PC points.
//
// For use:
//             .../midACPCpoint --inputLandmarkFile {NameinputlandmarkFile}.fcsv --outputLandmarkFile
// {NameOfoutputlandmarkFile}.fcsv
