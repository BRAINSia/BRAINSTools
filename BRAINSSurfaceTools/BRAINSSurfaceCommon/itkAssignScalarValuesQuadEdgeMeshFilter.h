/**
 * \class AssignScalarValuesQuadEdgeMeshFilter
 * \brief This filter was initially proposed to assign resampled moving values back onto FixedMesh.
 *
 *
 * This filter takes two inputs as source and input meshes and assumes that
 * the points in the input are one-to-one for the points
 * in the source Mesh. Then, it assigns the scalar values of the source mesh points
 * to the points of the input mesh.
 * \ingroup MeshFilters
