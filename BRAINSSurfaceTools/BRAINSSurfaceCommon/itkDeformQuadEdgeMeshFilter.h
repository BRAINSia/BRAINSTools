/**
 * \class DeformQuadEdgeMeshFilter
 * \brief This filter deforms the mesh of its first input by applying the
 * deformation field implicity defined by the second and third inputs.
 *
 * This filter takes two meshes and a point set as inputs. The points of the
 * first input mesh are deformed following the deformation vectors that are
 * implied by the second mesh and the point set of destination points.  Both
 * meshes are expected to be representing a Spherical geometry with a zero
 * genus topology. Each point of the input mesh is projected onto the reference
 * mesh, and the corresponding destination points are interpolated for it.
 *
 * The user must set explicitly the values of the sphere radius and center.
 * Both meshes are expected to have the same radius and center.
