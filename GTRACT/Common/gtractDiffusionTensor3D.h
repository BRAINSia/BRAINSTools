/** \class DiffusionTensor3D
 * \brief Represent a diffusion tensor as used in DTI images.
 *
 * This class implements a 3D symmetric tensor as it is used for representing
 * diffusion of water molecules in Diffusion Tensor Images.
 *
 * This class derive from the SymmetricSecondRankTensor and from it inherit
 * most of the Tensor related behavior. At this level we add the methods that
 * are specific to 3D and that are closely related to the concept of diffusion.
 *
 *
 * \author Jeffrey Duda from School of Engineering at University of Pennsylvania
 * \author Torsten Rohlfing from SRI International Neuroscience Program.
 *
 * This class was mostly based on files that Jeffrey Duda, Torsten Rohlfing and
 * Martin Styner contributed to the ITK users list during a discussion on
 * support for DiffusionTensorImages. A discussion on the design of this class
 * can be found in the WIKI pages of NAMIC:
